                “Good design is innovative,” stated the highly influential industrial designer Dieter Rams in his list
                of ten principles. Yet breaking new ground with never-before-seen website design is becoming
                increasingly challenging.

            <p class="box3">
                Mission statements aren't just for small or large companies. Many successful individuals, professionals,
                and investors have taken the time to craft a personal mission statement. These personal mission
                statements often incorporate the financial, professional, spiritual, and relational aspects of life.
                This, in turn, helps an individual maintain a healthy work/life balance that increases their personal
                achievement in all of these areas.

            <p class="box3">
                Knowledge gurus say great visionaries are highly successful people. Visions are life aims that we wish
                to accomplish at a certain point of time. But how many of us can actually define our visions precisely?
                Those who can, are the biggest winners.

                Regardless of how hard you work, if you are aiming for the wrong dream, then all that effort will only
                get you to the wrong destination faster, and that would be extremely disappointing.
