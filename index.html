                “Good design is innovative,” stated the highly influential industrial designer Dieter Rams in his list
                of ten principles. Yet breaking new ground with never-before-seen website design is becoming
                increasingly challenging.

            <p class="box3">
                Mission statements aren't just for small or large companies. Many successful individuals, professionals,
                and investors have taken the time to craft a personal mission statement. These personal mission
                statements often incorporate the financial, professional, spiritual, and relational aspects of life.
                This, in turn, helps an individual maintain a healthy work/life balance that increases their personal
                achievement in all of these areas.

            <p class="box3">
                Knowledge gurus say great visionaries are highly successful people. Visions are life aims that we wish
                to accomplish at a certain point of time. But how many of us can actually define our visions precisely?
                Those who can, are the biggest winners.

            <p class="pera4">The Coca-Cola Company yesterday launched its drinking water brand Kinley in Bangladesh,
                making a foray
                into
                the fast-growing segment of the beverage market.

                The water brand is already available in India, Pakistan and Nepal, said the US beverage company in a
                statement.

                For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel.
                “The brand comes with the assurance of safety and purity from the Coca-Cola Company which is introducing
                Kinley with state-of-the-art technical capability along with their stringent quality norms, to ensure
                utmost
                purity of the product.”

                The company plans to roll out a campaign over the next few months.


                At the launch, Shadab Khan, managing director of Coca-Cola Bangladesh, said: “Kinley is a brand trusted
                around the region, and we are excited to bring it to the consumers in Bangladesh.”

                Khan said internal researches suggested that packaged drinking water in Bangladesh is a fast growing
                category and is considered the second largest in the non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverage category
                after
                sparkling products.

                A 500ml bottle of Kinley water will cost Tk 15, said the statement.
